### Product Recommendation System Using Efir Brand Data

This project focuses on building a product recommendation system by utilizing product data from the Efir brand's webpage. The workflow includes:

1. **Data Collection**: Extracting product data from the Efir brand's feed.
2. **Data Preparation**: Using pandas to adjust and clean the data in a DataFrame format.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Leveraging product descriptions as the source data, applying TF-IDF vectorization to extract relevant features.
4. **Similarity Calculation**: Implementing cosine similarity using scikit-learn to determine product similarities.
5. **Recommendation System**: Predicting and recommending products based on the calculated similarities.
6. **Clustering**: Applying the knee method to estimate the optimal number of clusters for product categorization.

This system is designed to provide accurate and efficient product recommendations, enhancing the user experience on Efir's platform.
